Things about being an organiser!

The term organise seem different to different persons. Some take it up as an easy task and some as difficult. It seems easy only if the person is going in it for the first time is unaware of the obstacles ahead.

I am not a managment student. I am a technical guy and involved in organising a festival with hundreds of ideas in my mind to implement and make it a festival as good that happened never before.

There comes a situation in life of every organiser whether to continue or not? especially when you are organising a festival in private institute with very limited budget, under infinite constraints, under several mental pressure. My Advisor asked me at the time of interview, A time will come when all limits will be crossed, will you work in that conditions and my reply to that was : definetely.
What made me say this? Its was my enthusiasm for the fest. My ideas that I wanted to implement. A adventurous journey that was ahead of me. My wait from years to be on this position. My emotions that were attached with the festival.

Now the time came and my team decided to resign. And my reasoning power advised me to resign and support my team. The conditions were worse then ever. What should I do in this situation. I had put my 2 months effort into this and now I was about to resign. The 90 persons whom I was leading was looking upon me with full support and belief that I will do what is right.

I resigned.

I along with my team was called upon by the Director. We gave our explaination. He heard all of us. He made us realise by his decency that how much we had fallen and how shameful act we had committed. He was right for an instance. But the circumstances/working conditions were not in favour of us. 

We were right, he was right. We had not found a solution. 

Then, we both compromised on our parts and agreed to go as it was. And I told my team to go with full enthusiasm once again. But there were different stands now. How should we tackle this? How can we bring together the team that was now divided?

This question is still before us!! There is work to do that requires 48 hrs in a day to complete. There is a team problem before us. There are personal life to manage. And management is not an easy task!!
